Generate a complete, responsive, single-page website using only **HTML and Tailwind CSS** for a luxury Airbnb-style condominium listing named "Carib Condominiums, Ocho Rios."

**Objective:** Mimic the clean, visual-first, and high-conversion UI/UX of modern vacation rental platforms.

**Styling & UX Requirements:**
1.  **Color Palette:** Use ocean blues (primary), sandy neutrals (backgrounds), and a vibrant teal/coral for CTAs. Use a clean, sans-serif font stack.
2.  **Responsiveness:** Ensure a mobile-first design that adapts flawlessly to tablets and desktops.
3.  **Visuals:** Use clear placeholder text within image containers (e.g., `[Full-width Ocean View Hero Image]`) or simple gray placeholder divs.
4.  **Persistent Element:** Include a **fixed/sticky** side or bottom booking widget (a simple form with check-in/out date inputs and a "Book Now" button) visible upon scrolling on desktop and condensed on mobile.

**Section Structure (Use smooth-scrolling IDs):**

1.  **Hero/Header (`#home`):**
    * Fixed Navigation Bar (Home, Amenities, Gallery, Location, Book Now).
    * Full-width Hero Section with a compelling title: "Your Contemporary Ocean View Escape in Ocho Rios" and a primary CTA.
2.  **Apartment Overview (`#about`):**
    * Brief description highlighting comfort, privacy, and the sea view.
    * Key Stats (2 Bedrooms, Sleeps 4-6, Sea View, Secure Parking) displayed in a responsive grid with simple icons (use placeholder `<div>` or text icons).
3.  **Amenities (`#amenities`):**
    * Use a clean, two-column layout (on desktop) of bulleted lists with prominent, simple icons. Include: Direct Beach Access, Free Wi-Fi, A/C, Private Patio, Community Pool.
4.  **Gallery (`#gallery`):**
    * A responsive 3-column grid of image placeholders for the interior and exterior (e.g., Kitchen, Bedroom, Pool, Patio View). Implement a simple hover effect (e.g., slight scale or overlay).
5.  **Location (`#location`):**
    * Section title: "Ocho Rios at Your Doorstep."
    * Placeholder for a map (`[Embedded Map Placeholder]`).
    * List key travel times: Mahogany Beach (1 min walk), Dunn's River Falls (10 min drive).
6.  **Testimonials (`#reviews`):**
    * Display 2-3 blockquote-style review cards.
7.  **Footer:**
    * Final, prominent CTA.
    * Contact Information (placeholder text).

**Focus on clean utility classes and appropriate use of flexbox/grid for layout.**
