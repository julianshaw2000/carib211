Anthony is a fantastic host! Very responsive to all of my questions about the Airbnb, the neighborhood, and Jamaica on a whole! The property is set in the most beautiful cliffside setting and the view from the balcony is jaw dropping! The apartment is spacious, with all the amenities needed to make for a great stay! Highly recommend and I’ll definitely book with Anthony again on my next visit to Jamaica.

Anthony's place was simply stunning.  The panoramic views of the ocean were just breathtaking.  The condo is located in a older style building, but once you get inside the condo, everything is updated and tastefully furnished.
There is a local beach right by the property that will give you a true taste of Jamaica's culture, plus there is a little wade pool in the ocean at the opposite end of the property.
Anthony was an amazing host. He responded quickly and provided suggestions for dinner. If you want an authentic Jamaican experience with stunning sunrises and sunsets, don't hesitate to book.

The view is the highlight of the apartment and definitely spectacular. The first floating bar is right next door at Mahogany Beach and the music doesn’t stop until about 5am. The windows are louvered so it’s as if you are at a party all night. We slept in the living room on the sofa.

Thanks for hosting us, Anthony. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The apartment is in excellent condition, clean and comfortable. We had no issues and definitely plan on returning again soon.
I see the new gate is in and the beach issues are being resolved. It is a lovely beach.
And that view.  Morning bliss, spectacular sunsets....
Shout out to the food recommendations. Blue Hole is a must!

Everything was very good. We were very relaxed. Condominium with security, a wonderful balcony view where we had all our meals. We'll definitely be back.

Anthony was exceptionally respectful, polite, helpful and responsive! OMG… I was blown away by the panoramic view of the ocean from the patio. Great spot to meditate amidst the soft splashes of the ocean. Another lovely feature was the closeness of the private beach with lots of musical tunes from the Caribbean. I shall return Anthony!!!
Additionally, the unit was spacious with lovely paintings and natural plants.

The view was the most amazing part of our trip.  It was a 3 min walk to the beach for swimming and jerk chicken. I do wish we would have rented a car because we didn’t love walking around. Uber was available though.

flat needs a paint up pretty dreary some cash spending needed   but worst of all no access to the sea !  nearest beach Mahogany somewhat unsavoury drug dealing  drinking at unpleasant bar and loud music all day and most of night   there should have been a disclaimer published over sea/beach access Poor!

Wow. I have never heard these complaints. Regardless I will investigate your concerns. The Mahogany beach is run by an outside interest and we the property owners will be addressing the concerns. Thanks for staying.

Although it was a short stay, we still had a great time at Anthony’s place. The highlight was definitely the beautiful balcony view overlooking the sea as it quickly became our favourite spot to relax and unwind. Additionally, the accommodation itself was clean, cozy, and well-equipped with everything I needed for a comfortable stay. We hope to return again :)

Mr. Anthony's reply is very quick. When we broke an equipment accidentally, he was courteous and precise in coming up with a solution. The rooms were all spacious and the bathrooms were large and comfortable to use.
